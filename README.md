# Calc

## What it is:

This is a basic functional calculator built in React in the style of a classic TI-83, with a hidden feature (hint somewhere on the page), because we all know what these were actually used for during math class.

## How to use:

You can either click the buttons on the calculator, or use your keyboard to type intuitively.
